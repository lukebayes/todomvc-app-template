## Implementation

If you don't already have Node and NPM in your PATH run, `make dev-install && source setup-env.sh`

To build the HTML document and JavaScript bundle run, `make build` and then, using a browser open `dist/index.html`.

If you'd like to build the minified versions HTML and JavaScript run, `NODE_ENV=production make build`.

To run the unit tests, `make test`.

To watch all files and run tests when a file changes, `make test-w` (note no space before "-w").
